## Description

This is a simple authentication app built with Node.js that demonstrates how to implement user authentication using various authentication strategies like email/password, OAuth(Google). The app provides a starting point for developers to understand and integrate authentication into their Node.js applications.

## Features

- User registration and login using email and password
- Social login with popular OAuth providers like Google.
- Session-based authentication for web-based applications
- Password reset functionality
- Securely hashed passwords using bcrypt
- MongoDB database for data storage
- Using redis(Kue) for parallel jobs.
- Using Recaptcha for verification of users.

## Installation

To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Alok515/AuthenticationApp.git
cd AuthenticationApp
```

2. Redis Setup for Parallel Jobs

For Linux (Arch Linux Based Distros)
```
sudo pacman -S redis
redis-server
```
For Other Operating Systems (Windows, Mac OS)
[Visit here](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/) For Redis Setup

or use Redis server from cloud services.

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Set up the environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and fill in the necessary environment variables:

```
# Example .env file
PORT = 8000
DataBase = Your DataBase  connection Link.
Session_Secret = Your Secret Session Key.
HashNum = Your Hash Number For Hasing Password.
client_id = Your Google Client ID.
client_secret = Your Google Client Secret.
email = Your Email Forwading Environment Variable.
passEmail = Your Email Forwading Environment Passcode.
recaptchaKey =  Google recaptcha Key.
REDIS_URL = Redis Server URL.
```

4. Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

## Usage

After completing the installation steps, the authentication app will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

Follow the app's user interface to register, log in, and use different authentication features.

## Technologies

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
